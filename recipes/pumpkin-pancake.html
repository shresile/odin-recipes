        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Wonderful recipe by Grandma Helen that Maria loves! Serve with syrup.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>¾ cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups cake flour</li>
            <li>1 ¾ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk buttermilk, pumpkin puree, egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract together 
                in a bowl until blended. Whisk in melted butter.</li>
            <li>Whisk cake flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together 
                in a bowl. Add flour mixture to buttermilk mixture and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or
                 whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. 
                 Fold egg whites into buttermilk-flour mixture to form pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or skillet over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls 
                onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form on top, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until 
                browned on the other side, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
