        <h2 class="title">Description</h2>
        <p>syd:These puff pastry-wrapped olives are our family's favorite holiday appetizer. 
            We make them with a variety of olives - pimento stuffed green, plump kalamata, Provencal - 
            just make sure they are pitted. We like to use strongly flavored olives; the flavor 
            of canned ripe olives disappears in the puff pastry. You can make these ahead, and freeze; 
            allow 30 minutes for the pastry to thaw before baking. Another advantage: the kids like 
            to make them and eat them.</p>
